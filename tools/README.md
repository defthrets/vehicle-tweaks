# tools/

Self-contained build toolchain. **Not committed** -- restore it with the script below.

`build.ps1` does not use `dotnet build`, because the .NET SDK on this machine is broken:
`C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\8.0.28` is a partial install (3 files
where 8.0.19 has 184), so every `dotnet` invocation fails on a missing `hostpolicy.dll`.
`dotnet --list-runtimes` still lists 8.0.28, which hides the cause.

Instead the build drives a Roslyn `csc.exe` that runs on .NET Framework directly. No SDK,
no Visual Studio, no admin rights. The same pattern is used by the fumes, hoodrich and
overspray repositories and is reusable for any net48 project on this box.

## Restore

```powershell
$tools = $PSScriptRoot
$pkgs = @{
  "roslyn" = "https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.net.compilers.toolset/4.8.0/microsoft.net.compilers.toolset.4.8.0.nupkg"
  "refasm" = "https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.netframework.referenceassemblies.net48/1.0.3/microsoft.netframework.referenceassemblies.net48.1.0.3.nupkg"
}
foreach ($k in $pkgs.Keys) {
  $zip = Join-Path $tools "$k.zip"
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $pkgs[$k] -OutFile $zip -UseBasicParsing
  Expand-Archive $zip (Join-Path $tools $k) -Force
  Remove-Item $zip
}
```

Produces:

- `tools\roslyn\tasks\net472\csc.exe` -- the C# compiler
- `tools\refasm\build\.NETFramework\v4.8\*.dll` -- net48 reference assemblies

If a sibling repo on the same machine already has these (fumes, hoodrich, overspray), copying
`tools\roslyn` and `tools\refasm` across is faster and needs no network.

The only other thing the build needs is `ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll`, which it takes from
whichever GTA V install is present. Both editions ship the identical file.

## icons.py

The settings panel's ten page icons, `assets\icon_*.png`, are drawn by this script rather than
by hand: white shapes on transparent, drawn at 512 and brought down to 128 with a Lanczos
filter so the edge is smooth at the twenty-odd pixels they are shown at. The panel tints them
at draw time, so one white file serves the lit page and the rest.

```powershell
python tools\icons.py            # rewrites assets\icon_*.png
python tools\icons.py --sheet    # and drops an iconsheet.png beside assets to look at
```

Needs Pillow. **This one is committed**; it is ours.
