# Vehicle Tweaks

Two small changes to how a car behaves in GTA V, for ScriptHookVDotNet. Neither of them
says a word while it works.

Both were written inside [Fumes](https://github.com/defthrets/fumes), the fuel mod, because
that is where the car code was. Neither is about fuel, so they live here instead.

## Manual ignition

The engine is something you operate rather than a side effect of sitting in the seat.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hold** the exit key | The engine stops. You stay in the seat. |
| **Tap** it | You get out, and the car is left exactly as it stands -- running if it was running, dead if you turned it off first. |
| **Get in** | Nothing starts until you touch the throttle, and only if the engine was already off. |

A car left running keeps its radio on, loud enough to hear from outside it, on whatever
station was playing as you got out. A car left switched off gets its radio switched off too --
a dead car with a stereo on is a flat battery.

**Above a brisk walk (2.5 m/s) the exit key is handed straight back to the game**, whole and
untouched, so vanilla's hold-to-bail still works exactly as it always did. A tap that ejects
you at sixty is not what a tap should do, and refusing the tap on its own would have left no
way out of a moving car at all.

Aircraft are excluded by default. The gesture that parks a car is the one that kills you in a
helicopter, and it is the same key you use to climb out on the ground.

## Steering-activated indicators

Hold the wheel over for a second and that side comes on. It cancels when you hold the wheel
the **other** way for 0.6 s -- which is what straightening out of a turn is -- or after two
seconds of driving straight.

**Letting go does not cancel it**, and the straight-ahead cancel only counts while the car is
actually moving. That is the whole design rather than a detail: it is what lets you signal at
a red light and then release the wheel. A cancel that only asked "is the wheel straight" would
put the indicator out a second after you set it.

Turning the same way again does not put it out either, and that needs saying because
straightening between two turns the same way is itself a turn the other way. Only a *held*
turn the other way cancels; a flick to line the car up does not.

## Install

Needs [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and
[ScriptHookVDotNet 3](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet).

Drop `VehicleTweaks.dll` and `VehicleTweaks.ini` into the game's `scripts\` folder. Works on
both the Legacy and Enhanced editions -- they ship the identical `ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll`, so
one build runs on both.

Zero external runtime dependencies: the BCL and SHVDN, nothing else. `scripts\` is one shared
assembly-resolution namespace, so a third-party dll in there is everybody's problem.

## Settings

Everything is in `VehicleTweaks.ini`, which explains what each setting is *for* rather than
just naming it. The names are the ones Fumes used, so numbers you tuned there can be copied
straight across.

The log goes to `scripts\VehicleTweaks\VehicleTweaks.log`, or to
`Documents\VehicleTweaks\` when the game folder is not writable -- which is what happens on a
normal Program Files install. Since nothing here talks on screen, that file is the only way
either feature can tell you what it did.

## Building

The `.NET` SDK on the machine this was written on is broken, so the build drives a
self-contained Roslyn instead. See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) to restore it, then:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Deploy
```

SHVDN shadow-copies script assemblies, so the dll in `scripts\` is usually not locked while
the game runs -- a live redeploy works, and the build tells you which key to press to reload
(it reads `ReloadKeyBinding` out of each install's own `ScriptHookVDotNet.ini` rather than
assuming; the two installs here disagree).
