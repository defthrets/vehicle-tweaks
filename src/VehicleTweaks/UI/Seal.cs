    /// one mod is not a shared mark, so this depends on nothing but SHVDN and drops into any

    /// TWO FILES, NOT ONE, and that is the whole trick. The band turns and the face does not,
    /// so they are separate textures drawn at the same place and the same size with only the
    /// band given an angle. The alternative is a spritesheet of thirty-odd frames, which is
    /// thirty-odd textures to ship and a stepped rotation instead of a smooth one.

    /// would orbit rather than spin. The canvas is padded out to put the two in the same place.
